<h2 id="machine-learning-solution">Machine Learning Solution</h2>
<p>The initial step in developing the Sentiment and Topic Prediction for News solution begins with the process of data annotation or labeling. Data from the news platform is processed using Topic Modeling techniques with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to assign topic labels to each news article. The outcome of this process is topic labels covering various aspects of news, such as Weather and Environment, Vehicles and Transportation, Fashion, Style, Culture, and Tourism, as well as other topics.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sentiment of each news article is also annotated using a pretrained language model from Hugging Face. This model provides sentiment labels such as Negative, Neutral, and Positive for each news article.</p>
<p>By conducting this data annotation, each news article has been assigned labels that depict the topic and sentiment contained within. The next step is to prepare the data for the classification process, aiming to predict the topic and sentiment of news articles accurately.</p>
<p>Once the annotation process is complete, the data is meticulously prepared to ensure its quality in the classification process. This includes cleaning text from special characters, converting text to lowercase, and removing irrelevant words. Subsequently, important features are extracted from the text using vectorization techniques such as TF-IDF, allowing the text to be transformed into numerical representations that can be utilized by Machine Learning models.</p>
<p>During the modeling phase, various Machine Learning and Deep Learning models are explored and evaluated. After numerous experiments, the chosen model for topic classification is logistic regression with parameter tuning, while for sentiment analysis, the selected model is LightGBM. These models are selected based on their performance and ability to generate accurate predictions for each news article.</p>
<p>With this Machine Learning solution, it is expected to provide accurate predictions for the sentiment and topics of each news article on Kompas.com. This will enhance the user experience by providing a more structured and intuitive platform to navigate through various news articles. Additionally, this solution can assist readers in finding and engaging with content that is relevant to their interests and needs.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-metrics">Machine Learning Metrics</h2>
<p>Recall is a crucial machine learning metric for evaluating the performance of sentiment and topic prediction models in the context of news articles. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive cases. In the context of sentiment prediction, high recall indicates that the model can effectively identify and classify positive, negative, and neutral sentiments from news articles. Similarly, in the context of topic prediction, high recall indicates that the model can accurately assign news articles to their respective topics, such as weather and environment, transportation, culture and tourism, government and programs, health and nutrition, finance and technology, crime, criminality, and public order, politics and sports.</p>
<p>The evaluation of recall for both sentiment and topic prediction models is essential to ensure that the models can accurately capture the diversity of sentiments and topics present in news articles on the Kompas.com platform. By optimizing recall, the machine learning solution aims to provide users with reliable predictions that enhance their experience and engagement with news content.</p>

<p><strong>Topic Modeling on WhatsApp User Reviews Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation</strong>
This research employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze 1710 user reviews of WhatsApp obtained from Google Play in August 2020. The research process involves five stages: problem identification, data retrieval, preprocessing, modeling, and analysis. The analysis results indicate the most frequently discussed topics, such as voice and video calls, call quality, as well as photo and video quality. We use perplexity as an indicator to determine the number of iterations and topics, where lower values indicate better model performance. The analysis phase includes observations of top terms and documents to label and describe the characteristics of each topic, enabling a better understanding of user preferences and experiences with WhatsApp. (Kharisudin, I., &amp; Masri'an, H.,2022)</p>
<p><strong>Topic Modeling on Online News.Portal Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)</strong>
Online news portals often display a plethora of articles without indicating the topics being discussed. However, these articles can still be read and analyzed. In "Your News," you can find the main topics and trends being discussed. You need a quick and efficient way to discover the trending topics in the news. One method to address this issue is through topic modeling. Topic modeling is essential to enable users to easily and rapidly understand modern theme developments.One algorithm used in topic modeling is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The research process begins with data collection, preprocessing, n-gram formation, dictionary representation, weighting, topic model validation, topic model formation, and topic modeling results. Based on the topic evaluation results, the best topic modeling values are obtained using coherence related to the number of passes and the number of topics, resulting in 20 passes, 5 topics with a coherence value of 0.53. This is considered sufficiently stable based on the standard coherence value (Fahlevvi, M. R., &amp; Azhari., 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Multiclass Classification Model Based on the Combination of IndoBERT Embedding and Long Short-Term Memory for Indonesian-language Tweets</strong></p>
<p>The combination of pre-trained IndoBERT and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) yields superior classification results, both on the original and modified datasets. The IndoBERT-LSTM model with optimal hyperparameters (batch size 16, learning rate 2e-5, and average pooling) achieves an F1-score of 98.90% on the original dataset and 92.83% on the modified dataset. The performance improvement of IndoBERT-LSTM over fine-tuned IndoBERT is not significantly pronounced (Iskandar Zulkarnain Maulana Putra et al., 2022).</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Class Text Classification of Uzbek News Articles using Machine Learning</strong></p>
<p>In this study, multiclass text classification is applied to texts written in the Uzbek language, specifically news articles from ten categories selected from the Uzbek online news edition "Daryo." Six different machine learning algorithms—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DTC), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Naïve Bayes Multinomial (MNB)—are employed for multiclass text classification. TF-IDF algorithm and n-gram models at the word and character levels are utilized as feature extraction methods. The hyperparameter determination for text classification involves 5-fold cross-validation. Experimental results show the highest accuracy reaching 86.88% (Rabbimov &amp; Kobilov, 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Building Multiclass Classification Model of Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Using the Chi-Square Test for Variable Selection Method.</strong></p>
<p>Feature selection using a filter approach indicates that all predictor features depend on the target feature. Independent predictor features include the mother's pre-pregnancy diabetes history (X2), father's blood pressure (X3), father's psychological condition (X8), and drinking water quality (X10). These features serve as inputs to the classification model. The class label distribution in the dataset is imbalanced, with Class 0 dominating around 70% of Class 0 examples, while there are only 0.33% or 3 out of 900 Class 1 examples. This class label distribution imbalance can affect the acquisition of a better classification model. The Decision Tree model outperforms the Logistic Regression model. Performance metrics, including Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are 90%, 89%, 90%, and 89%, respectively, for Logistic Regression compared to 91%, 90%, 91%, and 90% for the Decision Tree model. Additionally, the Decision Tree model can demonstrate the importance of features in the separation process during model construction (Nugroho et al., 2022).</p>
<h2 id="end-to-end-machine-learning-process">End-to-End Machine Learning Process</h2>
<p>The process will encompass Data Annotation, data preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, Data Modeling, and culminate in a Machine Learning Service using APIs. The entire system will be integrated into a Streamlit application with Docker for containerization, and the deployment will be facilitated through the Streamlit Share server.</p>
<h3 id="data-annotation">Data Annotation</h3>
<p><strong>Data Annotation Architecture Diagram</strong>

<img alt="1_data_annotation_topic_result_2" src="images/1_data_annotation_topic_result_2.png" /></p>
<p>In this context, data annotation was conducted using two different methods to gain deep insights into the existing content. Firstly, by applying Topic Modeling technique using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we successfully identified eight main topics within the data. Each topic was labeled based on keywords representing the essence of that topic, ranging from weather and environment to politics and sports.</p>
<p>Additionally, we performed sentiment annotation on the data by leveraging a pre-trained language model. This model allowed us to classify the sentiment of each data entity into three categories: Negative, Neutral, or Positive.</p>
<p>In evaluating the annotated data, we used the metrics of Perplexity Multicore and Coherence Score Multicore. A low Perplexity, such as the -8.23 we obtained, indicates better model performance. Meanwhile, a high Coherence Score, such as the 0.57 we achieved, signifies that the topics generated by the model have more consistent and meaningful interpretations. Thus, our annotated data results can be relied upon for further analysis in understanding and interpreting the existing content.</p>
<h3 id="data-preparation">Data Preparation</h3>
<p><strong>Data Preparation Architecture Diagram</strong>
<img alt="1_multiclass_prep" src="images/1_multiclass_prep.png" /></p>
<p>The data preparation process begins with reading raw data, followed by the definition of columns to be processed. This includes data validation, specifically checking data types, identifying duplicate data, and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets. Finally, the processed data is saved before proceeding to the data preprocessing stage.</p>

<h3 id="exploratory-data-analysis-eda">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
<p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Architecture Diagram</strong>
<img alt="2_multiclass_EDA" src="images/2_multiclass_EDA.png" /></p>
<p>Next is the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase. In this stage, exploration of the data is conducted to gain a deeper understanding. The process includes several steps. Firstly, Basic Text Exploration is performed, such as finding the "Content" with the longest and shortest names, examining products with titles containing specific characteristics, searching for rows containing punctuation or special characters, and finding rows with multiple spaces in the title column. Secondly, Data Proportion analysis is carried out by checking the proportion of data in terms of both the count and percentage of target labels. Thirdly, Text Representation involves representing words in text data. then, a WordCloud is generated to visualize word frequency, lastly, social network analysis, Time series analysis, outlier detection, and correlation analysis.</p>
<h3 id="data-preprocessing">Data Preprocessing</h3>
<p><strong>Data Preprocessing Architecture</strong>
<img alt="3_multiclass_preproc" src="images/3_multiclass_preproc.png" /></p>
<p>Moving on to the Data Preprocessing stage, the initial step after reading the data prepared in the Data Preparation phase is the execution of post-EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) actions, which are mandatory. These actions involve various operations aimed at cleaning and transforming the textual data to make it suitable for analysis. </p>
<p>Firstly, we perform operations such as removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, removing stopwords (commonly occurring words that do not carry significant meaning), and joining the words with a single space. These operations help standardize the text and eliminate noise from the data.</p>
<p>Following this, the data undergoes transformation using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization. TF-IDF assigns weights to unique and important words in a document, thereby distinguishing one document from another based on the frequency and importance of words.</p>
<p>Additionally, label encoding is applied to the target data, both for topics and sentiment. For topics, the label encoding maps each topic category to a numerical value. Similarly, for sentiment analysis, the label encoding assigns numerical values to sentiment categories (Negative, Neutral, Positive).</p>
<p>It's worth noting that stemming or lemmatizing processes are not performed in this preprocessing stage due to their computational intensity and resource requirements, which exceed the available resources at our disposal.</p>
<p>Label to Number Mapping (topic):
Cuaca dan Lingkungan: 0,
Kendaraan dan Transportasi: 1, 
Mode, Gaya, Kebudayaan, dan Pariwisata: 2,
Pemerintahan dan Program: 3,
Kesehatan dan Gizi: 4,

Kejahatan, Kriminalitas dan Ketertiban Umum: 6,
Politik dan Olahraga: 7.</p>
<p>Label to Number Mapping (sentiment):
Negative: 0,
Neutral: 1,
Positive: 2,</p>
<h3 id="data-modeling">Data Modeling</h3>
<p><strong>Data Modeling Architecture</strong>
<img alt="4_multiclass_modeling" src="images/4_multiclass_modeling.png" /></p>
<p>Once the data from the preprocessing stage is saved, it is loaded into the data modeling phase. Subsequently, the data undergoes the modeling process with experiments using various models such as extratrees, xgboost, gradient boosting, SVC, logistic regression, lightgbm, and deep learning. However, the best results, with the optimal evaluation metric values, are obtained using the lighgbm and Logistic Regression model, achieving a Test recall of 0.86 (topic) and 0.77 (sentiment).</p>
<h2 id="lightgbm">LightGBM:</h2>
<p>LightGBM is a powerful gradient boosting framework that stands out in multiclass classification tasks due to its remarkable speed and accuracy. It operates by iteratively training a series of decision trees, with each subsequent tree aiming to rectify the errors made by the preceding ones.</p>
<p>Instead of splitting the tree depth-wise like traditional methods, LightGBM adopts a leaf-wise tree growth strategy. This means it expands the tree node by node, selecting the split that offers the maximum reduction in the loss function. By doing so, LightGBM can efficiently find optimal splits, leading to faster and more effective model training.</p>
<p>In multiclass classification, LightGBM minimizes a specified loss function, typically the cross-entropy loss, to optimize its predictions. This loss function quantifies the difference between the predicted and actual class labels for each sample. By minimizing this loss, LightGBM improves its predictive accuracy across multiple classes.</p>
<p>In essence, LightGBM is highly efficient for multiclass classification, leveraging gradient boosting techniques and optimized tree growth strategies to achieve superior performance.</p>
<h2 id="logistic-regression">Logistic Regression:</h2>
<p>Logistic Regression serves as a foundational algorithm for multiclass classification tasks, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. It predicts the probability that each input belongs to each class using the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function.</p>
<p>The logistic function transforms the linear combination of input features and their respective coefficients into probabilities. Each class's probability is then calculated using the softmax function, which normalizes the probabilities across all classes.</p>
<p>During training, logistic regression adjusts its coefficients to minimize a specific loss function, typically the cross-entropy loss. This loss function quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted and true class labels for each sample. By iteratively minimizing this loss, logistic regression optimizes its parameters to make accurate predictions across multiple classes.</p>
<p>In summary, logistic regression is a straightforward and interpretable algorithm for multiclass classification, making it suitable for tasks where model interpretability is crucial.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The machine learning service process begins with user input, where the provided data is converted into a Pandas dataframe. The input data undergoes a data defense process to ensure compatibility with the pre-trained model. Subsequently, special characters are removed, and the text is converted to lowercase. Stopwords are then removed, and the remaining words are joined with a single space. The cleansed data undergoes transformation using TFIDF, and finally, predictions are made using the pre-trained model saved during the data modeling phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the prediction phase, users input data through the Streamlit web interface, serving as the front end of the application. Upon the user's click on "Predict," the data is sent as a request to the back end. The back end processes the request and responds with the prediction results to the user.</p>
